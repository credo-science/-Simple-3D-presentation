Presentation of detection from a 2D graphic to 3D file.
1. First, run project1.exe, open a graphic file with detection (50x50pix) and create a CSV file.
2. We run the 3Dplot.py script and get a detection image in 3D.

The PROJEKT1.EXE file is written in LazarusPascal for Windows. Saves the Z height data in the CSV file. Height is the brightness of the pixel.
